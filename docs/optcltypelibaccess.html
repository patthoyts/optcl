<h1 align="center">Type Library Access</h1>

<p>OpTcl provides two means of accessing the type information
stored in a Type Library - graphical or command-line based, with
the graphical version being built on top of the command-line
commands. </p>

<h2 align="left">Command Line Access of Type Libraries</h2>

<p align="left">The command line access to type libraries is
implemented with the <em>typelib</em> namespace. Here's its
synopsis:</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<h4><a name="typelib::alllibs">typelib::alllibs</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::alllibs</strong> command returns a list
of registered libraries by their human readable names.</p>

<h4><a name="typelib::updatelibs">typelib::updatelibs</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::updatelibs</strong> command update OpTcl's
internal list of registered libraries from the system registry.</p>

<h4><a name="typelib::libdetail">typelib::libdetail</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::libdetail</strong> command returns a list
of three elements - the unique identifier for the library, its
major version number, and its minor version number.</p>

<h4><a name="typelib::load">typelib::load</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::load</strong> takes as its only parameter,
the human readable name of a registered Type Library. If
successful in loading the library, the command returns the
programmatic name for the library. Otherwise, the function
returns an error.</p>

<h4><a name="typelib::unload">typelib::unload</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::unload</strong> command takes as its only
parameter, the human readable library name of a registered Type
Library. If the library has been loaded, it is subsequently
unloaded.</p>

<h4><a name="typelib::isloaded">typelib::isloaded</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::isloaded</strong> command returns true if
and only if its only argument is the user readable name of a
library that is currently loaded.</p>

<h4><a name="typelib::loaded">typelib::loaded</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::loaded</strong> command returns a list of
the currently loaded libraries, in terms of their programmatic
names.</p>

<h4><a name="typelib::types">typelib::types</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::types</strong> command takes as its only
required parameter, a programmatic name for a loaded library. It
returns as its result a list of types defined in the library.
Each element of this list is composed of two elements: a type
category followed by the <a href="optcltypes.html">name of the
type</a>. Types fall into one of the following categories.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>Category</strong></td>
        <td valign="top"><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>enum</strong></td>
        <td valign="top">An enumeration type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>struct</strong></td>
        <td valign="top">A record/structure type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>union</strong></td>
        <td valign="top">A union type. Currently OpTcl can't
        manipulate these.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>typedef</strong></td>
        <td valign="top">An alias to another type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>module</strong></td>
        <td valign="top">Globally declared functions (currently,
        OpTcl cannot call these).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>interface</strong></td>
        <td valign="top">A collection of functions that implement
        the objects methods, and its properties (get and set
        functions). OpTcl cannot call these directly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><strong>dispatch</strong></td>
        <td valign="top">The same as interface, except that OpTcl
        can call these directly. Usually a dispatch interface
        wraps an inherited interface type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><a name="class"><strong>class</strong></a></td>
        <td valign="top">A collection of interfaces (or
        dispatches), broken into two categories: incoming and
        outgoing. Incoming interfaces are those that are used to
        invoke methods or access properties of an object, whilst
        outgoing interfaces generate events from an object. In
        each category, a class type can specify a default
        interface. Each OpTcl object is associated with a maximum
        of one class type.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="typelib::typeinfo">typelib::typeinfo</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>typelib::typeinfo</strong> command returns
information for either a type (in the form <em>lib.type</em>) or,
if provided as the last parameter, an element of a type. These
two forms are described as follows.</p>

<h5>Type Information</h5>

<p>The first form returns a list with four items. The first item
is the type's category. The second is a list of methods supported
by the type; the third is a list of properties for the type. The
last item is a list of <a href="optcltypes.html">fully formed
names</a> of inherited types.</p>

<h5>Element Information</h5>

<p>Information of an element is stored in a list of three
elements: the category of the element (either <em>method</em> or <em>property</em>),
its signature, and documentation string (null, if not provided by
the library). </p>

<p>The format for an element's signature is based upon the
elements category. <em>method</em> elements return a signature
that is a list, with the first item being the return type of the
method, the second being the name of the method, and the
remaining elements being its <a href="#Parameters">parameters</a>.</p>

<p>For a <em>property</em> element, the signature is a list with
the first element being the access flags to the property (a
combination of <em>read</em> or <em>write</em>), followed by the
properties type and its name. The remaining list elements are the
<a href="#Parameters">parameters</a> required to access an
indexed property.</p>

<h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4>

<p>A parameter description in OpTcl is a list with three required
members and one optional. </p>

<p>The first list element is a collection of flags describing the
direction of information flow for the parameter. This can either
be <em>in</em>, <em>out</em>, or both together. A parameter
flagged as <em>in</em> indicates that information flows from the
caller to the callee (by value call). A parameter flagged with <em>out</em>
indicates that information flows from the callee to the caller.
In the case of both flags being present, the information flow is
bi-directional (call by reference). It is important to note the
significance of this when operating with COM objects from OpTcl.
A parameter that is <em>out</em> or <em>inout</em> requires the
name of a Tcl variable to hold the value of the parameter. In the
case of <em>inout</em> the variable must exist prior to the
method call. Currently, OpTcl doesn't make full use of type
information for event handling. All parameters of an event are
passed to Tcl by-value only, for the time being.</p>

<p>The second list element is the <a href="optcltypes.html">correctly
formed type-name</a> of the parameter. The third list element is
the parameters name. The final optional list element is either a
question mark, '?', indicating that the parameter is optional, or
some other value, denoting a default value. OpTcl currently does
not fill-in missing parameters with their default values.</p>

<h2>Graphical Method for Accessing Type Libraries</h2>

<p>For this OpTcl defines the <em>tlview</em> namespace. Here is
a synopsis of the commands defined within it:</p>

<dl>
    <dd><a href="#tlview::refview"><strong>tlview::refview</strong></a>
        <em>windowpath</em> </dd>
    <dd><a href="#tlview::loadedlibs"><strong>tlview::loadedlibs</strong></a>
        <em>windowpath</em> </dd>
    <dd><a href="#tlview::viewlib"><strong>tlview::viewlib</strong></a>
        <em>libname</em> </dd>
    <dd><a href="#tlview::viewtype"><strong>tlview::viewtype</strong></a>
        <em>libname.typename</em> </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Description</h3>

<h4><a name="tlview::refview">tlview::refview</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>tlview::refview</strong> command creates a
toplevel window that displays a list of system-registered
typelibraries. Here's a screen-shot:</p>

<p><img src="refview.gif" width="406" height="367"></p>

<p>In blue are the libraries currently loaded by OpTcl; the
others aren't loaded. The Refresh button updates the list.
Clicking on a library, either loads or unloads it, depending on
its currently status. At the bottom of the screen, a status bar
informs of result of the most recent operation.</p>

<h4><a name="tlview::loadedlibs">tlview::loadedlibs</a></h4>

<p>Once a library is loaded, it is referenced within OpTcl using
a programmatic identifier; in fact, this is true for any client
of COM's type-libraries - e.g. Visual Basic. The <strong>tlview::loadedlibs</strong>
command creates a toplevel window, hosting a list of currently
loaded libraries, in terms of their programmatic id. Heres's a
screen-shot:</p>

<p align="left"><img src="loadedlibs.gif" width="203"
height="154"></p>

<h4 align="left"><a name="tlview::viewlib">tlview::viewlib</a></h4>

<p align="left">The list is automatically updated, every time the
window receives mouse focus. Here's where the fun begins. Each
element is mouse-sensitive - clicking on one creates a browser
window for that library. At any time, a type browser can be
opened using <strong>tlview::viewlib</strong> command. The system
ensures that there is only one browser per library. Here's a grab
of browser in action:</p>

<p align="left"><img src="viewlib1.gif" width="465" height="379"></p>

<p align="left">The left-hand pane contains a list of types
within the library. Clicking on any type displays its elements in
the right-hand pane. Elements in a typelibrary are organised in
terms of methods, properties and inherited types. The right-hand
pane sorts the elements into these basic groups. The lower pane
gives a description of the element last clicked. If the type
library provides any describing text for that element that is
also displayed. In the lower pane, if a non-primitive type is
used to describe either a property or an element of a method,
then that type will also be click-sensitive. For a more detailed
explanation please read the section on accessing elements of a
type.</p>

<h4 align="left"><a name="tlview::viewtype">tlview::viewtype</a></h4>

<p align="left">The <strong>tlview::viewtype</strong> command can
call-up a browser window to view the details of a specific type
in a Type Library.</p>
