<h2>Description</h2>

<h3><a name="optcl::new">optcl::new</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>optcl::new</strong> command creates or attaches to
existing COM objects, returning a unique object identifier, if
successful. The -start flag is used to indicate that the call
should always create a new instance of the object. The -window
option creates with the COM object, a Tk widget that will attempt
to in-place activate the user interface of the object. Not all
COM objects provide a user interface, and not all objects with
user-interfaces will in-place activate. </p>

<p>The final parameter of the command is an identifier for the
COM class of the object. This can take four different forms:
CLSID, ProgID, document path or raw HTML. Currently, the latter
two only work with the -window option. A CLSID is a string
representation of a COM Globally Unique IDentifer (GUID for short).
CLSIDs uniquely identify the location of a COM class server
through the system registry. To successfully create an instance
of the COM class, the server must be correctly registered with
the system registery. An example of a CLSID is <em>{8E27C92B-1264-101C-8A2F-040224009C02}</em>
(the CLSID for the Calendar Control). In order to pass a CLSID
correctly to the <strong>optcl::new</strong> command, the CLSID
must be wrapped in an extra pair of braces. This will ensure that
the bracing surrounding the CLSID is not stripped by the Tcl
interpreter. For example, <em>{{8E27C92B-1264-101C-8A2F-040224009C02}}</em>.
A ProgID (programmatic identifier) is a human readable name that
performs the same job as a CLSID. For example, <em>MSCAL.Calendar.7</em>.
</p>

<p>Additionally, the command can take two further forms of
identifer. A URL to a document with a correctly registered
document server, or an inline HTML. Both these options are only
available currently with in-place activation only (-window option)
and require the installation of Internet Explorer 4.0 or above.
To use inline HTML, the source string must begin with the
characters &quot;mshtml:&quot;.</p>

<h3><a name="Reference Management">Reference Management</a></h3>

<p>At the time of writing, OpTcl cannot provide a robust
automatic handling of object lifetimes. So for now, the <strong>optcl::lock</strong>
and <strong>optcl::unlock</strong> commands provide explicit
means for respectively incrementing or decrementing the reference
count on an object. On creation, the reference count of an object
is one. If, the reference count of an object becomes zero, the
object is destroyed, together with its Tk container window, if
one exists. Furthermore, the destruction of a container window,
will immediately destroy its related object.</p>

<h3><a name="optcl::isobject">optcl::isobject</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>optcl::isobject</strong> command returns true if
and only if its only parameter is an OpTcl object.</p>

<h3><a name="optcl::interface">optcl::interface</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>optcl::interface</strong> command performs the
role of querying the current interface name of an OpTcl object,
or setting it to a new interface type. COM objects are
polymorphic, in that they can (and often do) support multiple
interfaces. In OpTcl an interface name is a <a
href="optcltypes.html">properly formed type</a>, and hence can be
browsed with the <a href="optcltypelibaccess.html">Type Library
Access functionality</a> of OpTcl. One can discover the supported
interfaces of an object by <a href="#optcl::class">finding</a>
and viewing details of its <a
href="optcltypelibaccess.html#class">COM class</a>. The initial
interface of an object, is its default interface.</p>

<h3><a name="optcl::class">optcl::class</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>optcl::class</strong> command returns the <a
href="optcltypelibaccess.html#class">class name</a> of the object.
If no class name information is provided, the command returns
'???'.</p>

<h3><a name="optcl::bind">optcl::bind</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>optcl::bind</strong> command binds an event from
an object to a Tcl procedure name. The event can either be the
name of an event on the default interface, or the name of an
event on another event interface. The latter must take the form <em>lib.eventinterface.event</em>.
The Tcl procedure will be called with the first parameter being
the object identifier of the OpTcl object raising the event,
followed by the parameters of the event itself.</p>

<h3><a name="Object Command">Object Command</a></h3>

<p>The object identifer returned from <a href="#optcl::new"><strong>optcl::new</strong></a>,
is also a Tcl command for the lifetime of the object. Using the
command, we can invoke the object's methods, and properties. As a
means to improving efficiency, both forms of member access can be
applied to a <a href="#Sub-Objects">sub-object</a> of the invoked
OpTcl object. Methods can be invoked on an object, by appending
to the object command (with a possible sub-object), the method
name and its <a href="optcltypelibaccess.html#Parameters">parameters</a>.
</p>

<p>Access to properties of an OpTcl object are differentiated
from method invocations by the placement of a <strong>:</strong>
prior the property name, with white space seperating it from the
name. For example to set the <em>visible</em> property of an
object to true, we would use the following syntax:</p>

<pre>	$myobj : visible 1</pre>

<p>And to retrieve it:</p>

<pre>	$myobj : visible
	<em>==&gt; 1</em></pre>

<p>If the property is indexed, then its index can be specified
within matching braces as a comma-seperated list. For example:</p>

<pre>	$myobj : grid(3,4) &quot;foo&quot;</pre>

<h3><a name="Sub-Objects">Sub-Objects</a></h3>

<p>COM objects often have deep hierarchies of objects, reachable
from the created object. In many cases it may be inefficient to
represent several of these objects within the hierarchy as OpTcl
objects, in order to access a single object. For this purpose,
the object command can take the -with option. This is a dot
seperated list of sub-objects that it has to traverse before
invoking the method or property. For example:</p>

<pre>	$app -with documents(1) save
	$xl -with workbooks(1).worksheets(sheet1).range(a1,b2) : value 15</pre>
